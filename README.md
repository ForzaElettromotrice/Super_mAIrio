# 🎮 SupeRL_mAIrio

**A Reinforcement Learning AI for Super Mario Bros.**\
SupeRL_mAIrio is a project developed by a group of students for the AI Lab course in the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of La Sapienza.\
The project team includes:

- [Daniele Venturini](https://github.com/Dalphan)
- [Diana Pamfile](https://github.com/LadiDBug)
- [Simone Rufo](https://github.com/simonerufo)
- [Leila Zanoni](https://github.com/LleilaA13)

🚀 The aim of the project is to build an AI agent that learns to play Super Mario Bros using reinforcement learning. The agent interacts with the game environment, mastering levels through rewards and penalties.

## 🎮 Game Environment
The project is based on the [gym-super-mario-bros](https://github.com/Kautenja/gym-super-mario-bros) environment, which is a custom environment for OpenAI Gym that allows the user to play the Super Mario Bros game.
