# Super_mAIrio
Super_mAIrio is a project developed by a group of students for the course of AI Lab of the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of La Sapienza.\
The project is developed by: 

- [Daniele Venturini](https://github.com/Dalphan)
- [Diana Pamfile](https://github.com/LadiDBug)
- [Simone Rufo](https://github.com/simonerufo)

The objective of the project is to create an AI agent that can play the Super Mario Bros game, exploiting a reinforcement learning approach based on Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN).

## Description
The project is based on the [gym-super-mario-bros](https://github.com/Kautenja/gym-super-mario-bros) environment, which is a custom environment for OpenAI Gym that allows the user to play the Super Mario Bros game.
